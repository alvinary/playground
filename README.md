Assorted functions, including

* A racket function for generating random connected graphs. These graphs are slightly biased, since they are simply random graphs (generated using the renyi model) to which a simple path has been superimposed in order to ensure connectedness (random-connected-graph.rkt).
* A small set of haskell definitions that can be used to generate typed expressions (geneval.hs).

Currently as Draft:
* A python cli utility for "charting" citation networks based on article metadata from Google Scholar (scholar_network.py).
